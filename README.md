# PreWork Study Guide

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- When studying anything new, one needs to store information to review later so they can refresh their memory.
- This has been created in efforts to effectively store notes for my coding bootcamp while simultaneously putting this info into practice.
- This provides a place for me to store notes as well as allowed me to refresh my memory on the basic concepts of html, css, and java.
- Most of the info pertaining to html, css, and javascript wasn't a foreign concept to me, however, this was an appreciated refresher. The git/github section also allowed me to see how one would interact with peers in a professional setting. Along with this I learned about the use of SSH keys and how to properly utilize the Git flow.

## Usage

To use this site all you have to do is examine the info. The info is split into 4 sections (html, css, git, javascript). To view the javascipt implemented, one must use chrome dev tools. One of the many advantages this project is that it provides a place to store notes you take throughout your coursework. It is important to have a note book, or in this case a note site, that you can look at to quickly access info you may forget during the course of this bootcamp. Along with storing info, this project allows students to reference how the basic concepts of html, css, and javascript are implemented in a real website. Even more so as the course continues, the student can add more info as they learn in more advanced ways, which will help the student store more knowledge effectively but also will allow the student to advance their skills through the practice of their new abilities.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
