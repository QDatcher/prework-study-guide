        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML acts as a skeleton for our webpages as it is language we use to structure out websites</li>
          <li>Many elements have class/id attributes that can give info about or even change the behavior/look of our elements</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>Within the head we have common child elements like <'title'> & <'meta'> </li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>Inside our body element we have many child elements we can use but headings like <'h1'> and paragraph elements (<'p'>) are most common</li>
          <li>Non descriptive (a.k.a non-semantic) elements like <'div'> and <'span'> have their place but semantic elements like <'form'> or <'table'> are preffered</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Web devs can use 'style' attributes to add a style to a specific element</li>
          <li>To make coding easier to understand, web devs generally seperate html and css by making a style sheet file (normally labeled style.css)</li>
          <li>To link the html file to the css file, we use the <'link'> element inside the <'head'> element</li>
          <li>If there is overlap in our stylesheets between elements/class/id the order of specifity will be the order of effect. This means that  id holds greater weight than class which holds greater weight than element</li>
          <li>A border allows us to manipulate the line that outlines the edge of our elements size/color</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>When assigning color we can use words (blue, green), hex (#be3455) and many other forms</li>
          <li>We normally use pixels, em, and rem units to denote the size of something</li>
          <li>To denote a class we put a period in front (.card). To denote an id we put a hashtag in front (#card). Elements are just written plainly (h1). This is all within the stylesheet</li>

          <li>git pull origin main: Takes the most updated version of our project from the main remote repository and updates our local main branch</li>
          <li>git add -A: adds all the files in our working directory to the staging area to be commited</li>
          <li>git commit -m "commit-message": creates a version of our code that can be passed up to the main branch or at the very least used as a reference point to go back to. The commit message gives a brief description of the change in the commit</li>
          <li>git merge branch-name: merge the specified branch’s history into the current one</li>
          <li>git push origin branch-name: Transmit local branch commits to the remote repository branch and potentially makes a pull request</li>
